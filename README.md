This repository contains several tools or functions written for [LuaSTGPlus](https://github.com/9chu/LuaSTGPlus). (You need to get a full version [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1i4ZX4VF) at first.) Some of them also require codes [here](https://github.com/Xrysnow/lua-misc).

Be careful of EXPLOSION. I can guarantee nothing.
